// Reading a file something outside the app wrote, with "I could not read this" kept apart from "there
// was nothing to read" (#2879).
//
// Every handoff file in this repo crosses a language boundary, is written by a detached run or a
// launcher script, and is read through a decoder that can throw. Until #2873 every one of those reads
// discarded its error with a `try?`, so an unreadable file and an absent one were the same thing to
// every caller. That is what made a one-line decoding bug cost a day: the reply drafter's results file
// could not be decoded, the ingest returned as though there were nothing to ingest, and every AI reply
// draft Overture produced was dropped while the screen showed a spinner for it.
//
// An unreadable file is not an absent one (L105) and distinct causes need distinct messages (L11).
//
// The recording is done HERE rather than by each caller, and that is the design decision worth
// understanding. Several of these reads are deliberately best-effort and must go on behaving exactly as
// they do: a shortfall check with no record of what it asked for reports nothing rather than inventing a
// failure, and a progress file read once a second must never raise a warning per tick. Making each of
// those callers plumb a failure somewhere would have meant either changing behaviour that is correct, or
// (far more likely) leaving most of them silent, which is the defect being fixed rather than a fix.
// Recording at the read means every site gets a surface for free while keeping its own behaviour.
