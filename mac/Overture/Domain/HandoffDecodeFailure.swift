// Why a handoff file could not be read, in words that name the FIELD (#2873).
//
// Every handoff file in this repo is written by something outside the app (a detached AI run, a
// launcher script, an importer) and read through a decoder that can throw. A `DecodingError`'s
// `localizedDescription` is the same sentence whatever went wrong ("The data couldn't be read because
// it isn't in the correct format"), so it cannot say which field is missing, and that one fact is the
// whole of what makes such a failure actionable.
//
// #2873 is the cost of not having this: the reply drafter stopped writing one metadata field, the
// decoder threw `keyNotFound("generatedAt")` on every real results file, the throw was discarded by a
// `try?`, and every AI reply draft was dropped in silence while the sheet showed a spinner for it. The
// field was never named anywhere, which is why it took a day to find.
//
// Pure and shared on purpose: #2879 sweeps the other ingest sites, and each one needs the same sentence
// rather than its own.
