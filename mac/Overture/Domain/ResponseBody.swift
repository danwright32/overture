// Reading the body of a response that ARRIVED, with "I could not understand this" kept apart from
// "there was nothing in it" (#2888).
//
// #2879 did this for the handoff FILES and its derived guard named this second set of sites without
// covering them, because the remedy differs (L129). A file sits on disk and can be re-read; a response
// is gone the moment it is discarded. Until this, eighteen reads of live responses discarded the error
// with a `try?`, so a 200 whose body did not decode became: no reply (`ReplyDetection`), no bounce
// (`BounceDetection`, so a pitch that bounced reads as delivered) and a calendar with no listings
// (`AlgoliaCalendar`, `SquarespaceCalendar`). An HTTP status failure was already handled at most of
// those sites. A 200 with an unreadable body was not.
//
// THE CALLER'S BEHAVIOUR IS UNCHANGED, deliberately, and that is the same decision #2879 made. Several
// of these reads are correctly best effort: a reply poll that cannot read one response must go on to
// the next one rather than throwing, and a signature fetch that fails must not stop a send. Making each
// caller plumb a failure somewhere would have meant either changing behaviour that is right, or leaving
// most of them silent, which is the defect rather than a fix. Recording AT THE READ gives every site a
// surface for free while keeping its own behaviour.

// How each endpoint is behaving, counted rather than reported one response at a time (L77).
//
// THE CONDITION IS A RUN OF FAILURES, not a proportion, and that choice is the whole design. A
// proportion needs a minimum volume floor or it fires on the first failure of the session, and a floor
// silences the SATURATION case, which is the one worth knowing: a proportion cannot tell one bad out of
// two from twelve bad out of twelve (L139). A run needs no floor, so an endpoint polled every minute
// and one read twice a day are judged by the same rule. A quiet endpoint does take longer to reach the
// threshold, which is honest rather than ideal: the alternative is an alarm on a single bad response,
// and an alert that cries wolf is ignored (L36).
//
// The run ENDS on a success and on nothing else, the same rule `HandoffReadFailures` follows: the
// condition is over when the thing works again, and no amount of elapsed time is evidence of that
// (L160). The TOTALS are kept across a recovery, because they are what says this endpoint has been
// unhealthy today, which a cleared record could not.
